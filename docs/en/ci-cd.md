# CI/CD reference

The GitHub Actions workflows run the guarded analysis and publication gates on every push and pull request.

## Continuous integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yaml) runs on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`:

1. `uv sync --locked` installs the locked environment.
2. `uv run python format_repo_files.py --check` checks formatting.
3. `uv run python tests/run_test_suite.py unit -b --durations 30` runs the fast isolated suite.
4. `uv run python tests/run_test_suite.py repository-contract -b --durations 30` checks the repository contract.
5. `uv run python tests/run_test_suite.py all -b --durations 30` runs every assigned test.

A separate `redis-integration` job runs on `ubuntu-latest` with a `redis:7-alpine` service, sets `GSVIBE_REDIS_URL` and `GSVIBE_REDIS_PREFIX`, and runs `tests/run_test_suite.py redis-integration -b --durations 30`.

The `pages` job installs Node 24, runs `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:gamesymbols`, installs Chromium, and runs `npm run test:e2e` from the `pages/` directory.

## Game-symbol pull request validation

`gamesymbol-pr-validation.yml` classifies every non-closed pull request through a shared route contract. During the source-only rollout, generated-output branch syntax is recognized by the Python contract but remains on the source route until the output verifier is deployed atomically.

Branch protection depends only on the final `pr-validate` job. That job runs with `always()`, reads every routed job result explicitly, accepts skipped jobs only when the trusted plan did not select them, and fails fork analysis without granting the fork access to the protected self-hosted runner. Internal planner, hosted, and self-hosted job names are not required checks.

## Pages deployment

[`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) triggers on pushes to `main` that touch `pages/**`, `gamesymbols/**`, `configs/**`, or the workflow itself:

1. **build**: tests, lints, builds `pages/dist`, verifies current game-symbol bytes, and uploads the artifact.
2. **archive**: verifies that the `pages-snapshots` branch history is append-only (only `gamesymbols/<family-build>.<sha256>.json` additions), merges the immutable game-symbol snapshot archive, and pushes it.
3. **deploy**: deploys `pages/dist` via GitHub Pages and verifies the deployed CDN game-symbol bytes against the verification manifest.

GitHub Pages hosts only static assets; it never hosts the Process API/SSE service.

## Analyzer and CI argument reference

When driving the analyzer from CI, pass the same arguments as a local run — see [Binary acquisition and symbol analysis](analysis.md#analyze-configured-symbols). Batch analysis over every configured tag uses `-allgamever`; a single-tag run uses `-gamever`. CI jobs that only need to know whether binaries are already in place use `copy_depot_bin.py ... -checkonly`.
